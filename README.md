A simple logging package that helps you log colorized messages in Windows console and other operating systems.

Features
--------

+ Colors : The main reason for this package was to log text in the Windows console with the support of ANSI colors.
+ Argument parsing : log21's argument parser can be used like python's argparse but it also colorizes the output.
+ Logging : A similar logger to logging. Logger but with colorized output and other options such as levelname
  modifications. It can also decolorize the output if you want to log into a file.
+ Pretty printing : Have you ever wanted to colorize the output of the pprint module? log21's pretty printer can do
  that.
+ Tree printing : You can pass a dict or list to `log21.tree_print` function and it will print it in a tree-like
  structure. It's also colorized XD.
+ ProgressBar : log21's progress bar can be used to show progress of a process in a beautiful way.
+ LoggingWindow : Helps you to log messages and debug your code in a window other than the console.
+ CrashReporter : log21's crash reporter can be used to report crashes in different
  ways. You can use it to log crashes to console or files or use it to receive crash
  reports of your program through email. And you can also define your own crash
  reporter functions and use them instead!
+ Argumentify : You can use the argumentify feature to decrease the number of lines you
  need to write to parse command-line arguments. It's colored by the way!
+ Any idea? Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/MPCodeWriter21/log21/issues) or submit a pull request.
